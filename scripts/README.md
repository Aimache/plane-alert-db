# Readme

This folder contains several scripts used in the GitHub actions:

- `check_main_databases`: A script that is used to check whether the main databases are correctly formatted.
- `create_db_derivatives`: A script that can be used to create the derivative databases based on the `plane-alert-db.csv`, `plane_images.txt` and `blacklist.txt` files.
- `create_images_reference`: A tiny little script that I used to create the new `plane_images.txt` file. This file will be removed when we are sure the file of the new image is correct.
