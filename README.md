**NOTE - The main file format has changed from .txt to .csv - the old file will remain available (without updates) until 2021/05/01, at which point it will be deleted. Please update any links to the .txt file immediately**

This project consists of lists of 'interesting' aircraft, formatted as CSV files. The list is designed to work with the excellent https://github.com/kx1t/docker-planefence and takes the form 

- ICAO,Ident,Operator,Type,CMPG,$Tag,#$Tag2,Category,#$Link

e.g 406C1B,G-CNWL,Cornwall Air Ambulance,Bell MD-900 Explorer,Civ,Air Ambo,Choppa,M\*A\*S\*H,https://cornwallairambulancetrust.org/

Add these characters to the column headers to control the behavior of PlaneAlert

- "$" \- Tweet this column as #hashtag
- "#" \- Don't show on the website (it will ignore this for the ICAO field, which is always shown)
- "#$"\- Don't show on the website, tweet as a #hashtag

in the example above the #hashtags would be 'Air Ambo' and 'Choppa', and Tag2 will not be shown on the PA website.

\*CMPG = Civilian, Military, Police, Government

# Planefence
To use this list with Planefence, simply configure your planefence.config setup to include the following line:

- PF_ALERTLIST=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sportsbadger/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-db.csv

If you want to add the list in addition to your local plane-alert-db.txt list, you can do the following:

- PF_ALERTLIST=plane-alert-db.txt,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sportsbadger/plane-alert-db/main/plane-alert-db.csv

**Note -- the priority of use is first-to-last, so if you want your local list to be interpreted first, move it to the front of the list**

# Description of Categories
